## Live Debugging: Dev, Staging and Production 

As dev infrastructure grows more complex and distributed, gaining visibility into live code has become a challenging mission. Developers use Rookout to extract live data from their application without any restart or redeployment. With a single click of a button, they can set non-breaking breakpoints and review collected variables, metrics and snapshots on demand, while the application is running.

## Dynamic Logging 

Dev teams often suffer from logging-FOMO - Fear Of Missing Out: Trying to log everything all the time. This generates a significant amount of garbage logs and horrid signal/noise ratios. Rookout allows users to insert and remove log-lines on demand without restarts or redeployments. Our dynamic logging, enables teams to reduce FOMO, logging costs, and most importantly the heavy labor required to support intense logging pipelines and cleanups while developing.

## Dynamic Alerting and Monitoring 

Devs use Rookout as an effective alert management channel.  By combining Rookout's dynamic nature with its ability to pinpoint services/flows and drive data into any platform, devs create on-demand alerts, and on-the-fly targeting of specific errors, usage patterns, user sessions, and more. For example, Rookout can notify a Slack channel when a new user logged in, or when a specific user used a new feature.

## On-Demand Pinpoint Profiling

Metadata can be just as important as the data itself. Devs use Rookout to explore areas where they have performance concerns and pinpoint the root cause. As an example, performance overhead could be easily measured by comparing timestamps of selected lines. Rookout adds an additional layer of profiling to APMs with a more detailed and dynamic resolution.

##  Dev Collaboration and Handoffs 

With Rookout, devs see each others’ work side by side, and avoid stepping on their teammates’ toes. It allows teams to run separate yet sharable views on top of the software. As a result, Rookout has become a single source of truth; a goto place for devs to see reality as it is and collaborate, thus solving the classic "it works on my machine" problem.
Rookout can be used by devs, SREs and Support Engineers, who can all create better handoff flows. 

## On-Demand Analytics 

Everyone needs data, and with Rookout data-points are available to anyone with a click. Enabling Product, Marketing, Security, Sales, BI and others to have direct audited access to the data they need, without requiring R&D labor or even restarts. This frees up R&D to work on new features, and speeds ups and improves workflows across the organization.

##  On-Demand Tracing 

In addition to adding log lines, Rookout allows devs to get full stack traces with new spans by connecting to existing tracing solutions.


## Dev Training and Onboarding 

Diving into new code is hard. It is twice as hard when it’s legacy code, or in general, code written by someone else. Rookout allows devs to speed up their learning process by letting them observe the unfamiliar code “in the wild”: as it’s running live in its true surroundings.
