## Adding a Java Rook

__Pre-requisites:__  
- *Oracle Java 7/8 __or__ OpenJDK 1.7/1.8* ([download here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html))

1. Download our java agent :  
    ```bash
    $ curl -L "https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.rookout&a=rook&v=LATEST" -o rook.jar
    ```

2. Set your JVM to use the rook as a java agent :  
    ```bash
    $ export JAVA_OPTIONS="$JAVA_OPTIONS -javaagent:{DOWNLOAD_DIR}/rook.jar"
    ```
    
3. Add your source files to the .jar/.war/.ear when building.  
this can be done manually or through the help of a build tool such as [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) or [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/).
    
*For explanation on how to do this using Gradle or Maven head to our [installation examples](installation-java.md)*

Once your application is deployed, navigate to the Rookout App Instances page to make sure it is available for debugging.
If you encounter any issues, check out our [Troubleshooting section](troubleshooting-rooks.md)
