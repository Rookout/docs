Rookout Live Logger gives you full control of your logging verbosity.

## Log Verbosity

Use the log verbosity filters on the left-hand of the app to turn the wanted log levels on or off.

## Free text Filtering

Use the intuitive and robust Free Text Search to only switch on logs that contain a specific string.
This will help you pinpoint your search to logs related to a specific error message, function or returned value.

## Context based Filtering

Rookout integrates with OpenTracing based tools, as well as with MDC.
Use the Filter By field to only switch on logs that match the wanted context.
This will help you reduce logging overhead by only collecting logs relating to a specific service, transaction, user or account.
