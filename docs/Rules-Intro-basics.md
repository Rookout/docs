## Intro

Rules are “non-breaking breakpoints” that let the Rookout SDK deployed in your app know what data it needs to fetch, where to fetch it from, and what to do with it (how to manipulate it; where to send it).

## Rule structure

What to fetch (set action; log vs dump)  
Where to fetch it (file, line)  
What to do with it (processing; targets)  

## Setting Rules

Happy flow
