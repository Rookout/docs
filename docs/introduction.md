## What is Rookout

Rookout real-time instrumentation means you donâ€™t need to restart, redeploy or write code to see inside your app.
It also means you can debug your staging or production environments just easily as debugging on your local machine.

Rookout lets you debug apps written in Python, Java, or NodeJS, whether they are deployed on AWS, Azure, Google Cloud or on your bare metal.
All this is done while providing end-to-end security, coupled with a small footprint and a negligible performance impact.

### The Rookout Service (APP?)

Rookout is available at app.rookout.com and provides a web based IDE for real time debugging.
Once you have access to the Rookout Service, you'll be able to setup Rooks and Rules in order to debug your application.
The Rookout service also functions as an ETL component for TBD.

### Rooks and Rules

Rooks are the component that allows you to collect data directly from a running application.  
A Rook is a dependency that is loaded directly from your application as any other library.

Once a Rook is deployed with your application, a Rule can be set to watch a specific line of code.
A Rule defines what data will be collected, how it should be formatted, and where it should be sent.

For more information about Rooks and Rules see [Rooks Overview](rooks-index.md) and [Rules Overview](rules-index.md)
