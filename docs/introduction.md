Rookout real-time instrumentation means you donâ€™t need to restart, redeploy or write code to see inside your app.
Easily fetch data from any environment - cloud or local, dev or production;
And automatically send your data to your analytics, storage or alerting tools.

Getting started with Rookout is quite straight forward:

1. Sign up at our <a href="http://www.rookout.com/trial">sign up page</a> and get a Rookout Token

2. Install a Rook by importing our SDK:
