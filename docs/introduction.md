## Meet Rookout

Rookout real-time instrumentation means you donâ€™t need to restart, redeploy or write code to see inside your app.
It also means you can debug your staging or production environments just easily as debugging on your local machine.

Rookout lets you debug apps written in Python, Java, or Node.js, whether they are deployed on AWS, Azure, Google Cloud or on your bare metal.
All this is done while providing end-to-end security, coupled with a small footprint and a negligible performance impact.

## Hands-on Tutorial

In this tutorial you will be able to debug a simple sandbox application we wrote for you.
The sandbox application is available in Java, Node.js and Python flavors, and can easily be deployed using a provided Docker image.
Before moving forward, make sure you have a [Rookout account](https://www.rookout.com/trial/) and that you have [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed. You should also have your own Rookout Token, which will be used throughout the tutorial.
