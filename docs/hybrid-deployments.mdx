Rookout's hybrid SaaS architecture empowers customers to keep application data within their premise by separating the control plane from the data plane.

Keeping the control plane connected to the Rookout cloud retains the benefits of SaaS: ease of use, ease of maintenance, live updates, etc.
Keeping the data plane on-premise simplifies data governance concerns and is useful for a variety of security and compliance considerations.

## Architecture

Rookout hybrid architecture relies on two containers to process, store, and access application data:
- The controller acts as a proxy, optimizing network traffic and offloading processing from the monitored applications.
- The datastore is an in-memory cache making the data available for end users over a secure web endpoint.

### Agents

When using the hybrid architecture, configure your agents to connect to the relevant controllers:

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs
    defaultValue="env"
    values={[
        {label: 'Environment Variable / JVM', value: 'env'},
        {label: '.NET', value: 'dotnet'},
        {label: 'Node', value: 'node'},
        {label: 'Go', value: 'go'},
        {label: 'Python', value: 'python'},
        {label: 'Ruby', value: 'ruby'},
    ]}>
<TabItem value="env">

```shell

export ROOKOUT_CONTROLLER_HOST="wss://your-controller-host"

```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value='dotnet'>

```cs

using Rook;
Rook.RookOptions options = new Rook.RookOptions()
{
    token = "[Your Rookout Token]",
    labels = new Dictionary<string, string> { { "env", "dev" } },
    host = "wss://your-controller-host"
};
Rook.API.Start(options);

// ...

```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value='node'>

```javascript

const rookout = require('rookout')
    rookout.start({
        token: '[Your Rookout Token]',
        labels: {
            env: 'dev'
        },
        host: "wss://your-controller-host"
    }).then(/*Start your application here*/)

```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='go'>

```go

import (
    // ...
    rookout "github.com/Rookout/GoSDK"
    // ...
)

func main() {
    rookout.Start(rookout.RookOptions{
    Token: "[Your Rookout Token]",
    Labels: map[string]string{"env": "dev"},
    Host: "wss://your-controller-host",
})
    // ...
}

```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value='python'>

```python

import rook
rook.start(
    token="[Your Rookout Token]",
    labels={"env": "dev"},
    host="wss://your-controller-host"
)

```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value='ruby'>

```ruby

require "rookout"
::Rookout.start token: "[Your Rookout Token]", labels: {env: "dev"}, host: "wss://your-controller-host"

```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<div className="rookout-org-info" />

If you forget to set the Rookout controller host you will be unable to set a breakpoint, and you'll see the following error: "Agent attempted connection to SaaS."

### Targets

In the hybrid architecture processing and transmitting data to external targets is carried out by the controller.

## Deployment

Deploy using common infrastructure as code providers:

- Helm [chart](https://github.com/Rookout/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/rookout-hybrid) for Kubernetes.
- Terraform [module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/Rookout/rookout-deployment/aws/latest) for AWS.
- Terraform [module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/Rookout/rookout-deployment/azure/latest) for Azure.
- CloudFormation [module](https://github.com/Rookout/cloudformation-quick-deployment) for AWS.
