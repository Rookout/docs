### Required Configuration
To start a debug session, please define the following:
1. One or set of [filters](projects-labels.md), used to set the context of your debug configuration to specific instances of the application being debugged.
2. Connect one or more source code repositories - from GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab or your local file system.
    **It's important to note that when you connect or associate your application source code with your debug  session Rookout is never able to see your source code. They're loaded locally within your browser for the purpose of telling Rookout the line of code where you'd like to set a data collection point.**
3. All set, click on "Lets go" button and start your debug session.


### Bookmarks
You may want to save the state of your debug session. It can be done by using a bookmark.
It will save the following:
1. Connected source code repositories.
2. One or set of filters that have been selected.
