title: Rules Overview
---

Rookout Rules (yea, we couldn't help ourselves...) let you define a set of non-breaking breakpoints anywhere in your application code.
Each Rule instance determines the following:
- Breakpoint location (file name and line)
- The type of data to be fetched when the breakpoint (e.g. stack frame, log line)
- The formatting to be applied to the fetched data
- The target to which the fetched data will be sent (e.g. the Rookout IDE, Slack, DataDog and others)

Rules are usually set from the Rookout IDE, and are later modified by editing their JSON file.

Rookout uses a flexible language to specify data collection and processing rules.
We are constantly working on improving and simplifying the syntax. 
Feel free to reach out to us at docs@rookout.com with suggestions!

## Rule Structure

Rules are a well structured construct describing the data collection and processing.

Each rule is made of the following components:

1. **id** - the rule's unique identifier. Used to track all related events.
1. **template_id** - the template this rule was derived from.
1. **appearance** - this section customizes the display of the rule.
1. **selector** - this section defines for which Rooks this rule applies. It is in the form of a *script* returning 
True/False for each Rook.
1. **processing** - this section defines the data processing in the agent and sending the data to various targets. 
It is in the form of a *script*.
1. **server_processing** - this section allows configuring data processing as a service using the Rookout Cloud. Coming Soon!
1. **aug** - this section defines the way the data is extracted from the application. It is comprised of multiple 
sub-sectinos, more about them can be read [here](rules-aug.md). A quick overview:
    1. **location** - this section defines the event this aug applies to.
    2. **condition** - this section defines any additional limitations on when to execute the aug.
    3. **extractor** - this section defines any additional information to extract from the application before runnig the 
    action.
    4. **action** - this section defines what do when the aug is executed. 


## Script Language

Rookout uses a simple scripting language to allow data extraction, transformation and loading (ETL).

The scripting language is made of three main constructs:
- Namespaces - objects encapsulating the script state. They can be thought of as trees of variables.
- Paths - objects pointing to specific objects within the namespace.
- Operations - the tasks the script is executing. Those tasks use paths to refer to the script state.

Take a look at the following "Hello World" example script:

```json
{
    "operations": [
      {
        "name": "format",
        "path": "temp.message",
        "format": "Hello World"
      },
      {
        "name": "send_rookout",
        "path": "temp.message"
      }
    ]
}
```

This script is simply a sequence of two operations:
1. The format operation used to construct the "Hello World" string and store it in the "temp" namespace.
1. The send_rookout operation used to read the message from the namespace and send it to the Rookout Cloud.

 For more information check out the [uses](rules-uses.md) of scripts in Rookout and the available 
 [operations](rules-operations.md) and [paths](rules-paths.md).
