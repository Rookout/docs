### The Rookout App

Rookout is available at [app.rookout.com](https://app.rookout.com/) and provides a web based IDE for real time debugging.
Once you have access to the Rookout App, you'll be able to setup Rooks and Rules in order to debug your application.
The Rookout App also functions as an ETL component for fetching your logs and sending them to your favorite log and data tools.

### Rooks and Rules

Rooks are the component that allows you to collect data directly from a running application.  
A Rook is imported into your app as an SDK, and deployed with each instance of your app.

Once a Rook is deployed with your application, a Rule can be set to watch a specific line of code.
A Rule defines what data will be collected, how it should be formatted, and where it should be sent.

For more information about Rooks and Rules see [Rooks Overview](rooks-index.md) and [Rules Overview](rules-index.md)

### Scripting

Rookout provides a robust scripting capability which allows defining advanced Rule behavior.
For more information about Scripting check out [Script Uses](rules-uses.md).

### A word about Agents

In some cases, you may choose to set up local Agents to orchestrate local data collection and provide ETL functionality.
You can read more about this option in our [Agents overview](agent.md) page.
