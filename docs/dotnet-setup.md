This page will dive into the nitty gritty details on installing Rookout under various configurations.  
If you are encountering any difficulties with deploying Rookout, this is the place to look.

## .NET

The [.NET SDK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Rookout) provides the ability to fetch debug data from a running application in real time.  

## Setup

### NuGet Package

Rookout SDK is installed as a [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Rookout) in your application.

#### API

The Rookout SDK needs to be started using a simple API.

```cs
using Rook;
namespace Program
{
    class Program
    {
        static int Main(string[] args)
        {
            Rook.RookOptions options = new Rook.RookOptions() 
            {
                token = "[Your Rookout Token]",
                labels = new Dictionary<string, string> { { "env", "dev" } }
            };
            Rook.API.Start(options);
    
            // ...
        }
    }
}
```

## SDK API

The .NET SDK is loaded via an API.  
Configuration may be passed through the API or using OS Environment Variables.

### start

```cs
public static void Start(RookOptions opts)
```

The Start method is used to initialize the SDK in the background and accepts the RookOptions object with the following attributes:

| Argument &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Environment Variable &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Default Value | Description |
| ------------ | ----------------------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| `token` | `ROOKOUT_TOKEN` | None | The Rookout token for your organization. Should be left empty if you are using a Rookout ETL Controller |
| `labels` | `ROOKOUT_LABELS` | {} | A dictionary of key:value labels for your application instances. Use `k:v,k:v` format for environment variables |
| `host` | `ROOKOUT_CONTROLLER_HOST` | None | If you are using a Rookout ETL Controller, this is the hostname for it |
| `port` | `ROOKOUT_CONTROLLER_PORT` | None | If you are using a Rookout ETL Controller, this is the port for it |
| `proxy` | `ROOKOUT_PROXY` | None | URL to proxy server
| `debug` | `ROOKOUT_DEBUG` | False | Set to `True` to increase log level to debug |
| `git_commit` | `ROOKOUT_COMMIT` | None | String that indicates your git commit |
| `git_origin` | `ROOKOUT_REMOTE_ORIGIN` | None | String that indicates your git remote origin |

## Test connectivity

To make sure the SDK was properly installed and test your configuration (environment variables only), download and run TestConnectivity:
* [Windows .Net Framework](https://get.rookout.com/test_connectivity_windows_x64_framework.zip)
* [Windows .Net Core](https://get.rookout.com/test_connectivity_windows_x64_core.zip)
* [Ubuntu .Net Core](https://get.rookout.com/test_connectivity_ubuntu_x64.zip)
* [Mac .Net Core](https://get.rookout.com/test_connectivity_mac_x64.zip) - Use right click and open to allow the tool to run 

## Debug Information

Rookout requires your application to be deployed with debug information (Pdb files `<DebugType>pdbonly</DebugType>` or `-debug+`) and the optimize flag should not be enabled (`<Optimize>false</Optimize>`)   


Pdb (Program Data Base) file is a repository to maintain information about your application. 

It stores the important debug information such as:
* file names 
* variable names 
* offsets of the functions
* file hashes

Although Rookout doesn't run your program in debug mode, we need the PDB file to properly collect the data per your request.
