This page will dive into the nitty gritty details on installing Rookout under various configurations.  
If you are encountering any difficulties with deploying Rookout, this is the place to look.

## .NET

The [.NET SDK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Rookout) provides the ability to fetch debug data from a running application in real time.  

## Setup

### NuGet Package

Rookout SDK is installed as a [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Rookout) in your application.

#### API

The Rookout SDK needs to be started using a simple API.

```cs
using Rook;
namespace Program
{
    class Program
    {
        Rook.RookOptions options = new Rook.RookOptions() 
        {
            token = "[Your Rookout Token]"
        };
        Rook.API.Start(options);

        // ...
    }
}
```

<div class="rookout-org-info"></div>

## SDK API

The .NET SDK is loaded via an API.  
Configuration may be passed through the API or using OS Environment Variables.

### start

```cs
public static void Start() // Using only environment variables
public static void Start(RookOptions opts)
public static void StartWithExceptions(RookOptions opts)
```

All methods initialize the SDK in the background using the optional configuration in the `opts` argument.  
The simpler `Start` will never impact the application's flow, writing a failure to the console.

When using the Start() function remember to set the ROOKOUT_TOKEN in the enviroment variable:

```bash
# Export your token as an environment variable
set ROOKOUT_TOKEN=[Your Rookout Token]

# Optional, see Labels section below Projects
set ROOKOUT_LABELS=env:dev
```

<div class="rookout-org-info"></div>
  
The `StartWithExceptions` will throw on error, so make sure to wrap the invocation with an appropriate `try`/`catch` block.

| Argument &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Environment Variable &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Default Value | Description |
| ------------ | ----------------------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| `token` | `ROOKOUT_TOKEN` | None | The Rookout token for your organization. Should be left empty if you are using a Rookout ETL Controller |
| `labels` | `ROOKOUT_LABELS` | {} | A dictionary of key:value labels for your application instances. Use `k:v,k:v` format for environment variables |
| `host` | `ROOKOUT_CONTROLLER_HOST` | None | If you are using a Rookout ETL Controller, this is the hostname for it |
| `port` | `ROOKOUT_CONTROLLER_PORT` | None | If you are using a Rookout ETL Controller, this is the port for it |
| `proxy` | `ROOKOUT_PROXY` | None | URL to proxy server
| `debug` | `ROOKOUT_DEBUG` | False | Set to `True` to increase log level to debug |
| `log_file` | `ROOKOUT_LOG_FILE` | None | Path to file to use for the SDK logs (default is `%USERPROFILE%/rookout/dotnet-rook.log`) |
| `log_level` | `ROOKOUT_LOG_LEVEL` | None | Control the SDK logging verbosity |
| `log_to_stderr` | `ROOKOUT_LOG_TO_STDERR` | False | Set to `True` to have the SDK log to stderr |
| `git_commit` | `ROOKOUT_COMMIT` | None | String that indicates your git commit |
| `git_origin` | `ROOKOUT_REMOTE_ORIGIN` | None | String that indicates your git remote origin |

## Test connectivity

To make sure the SDK was properly installed and test your configuration (environment variables only), download and run [TestConnectivity.exe](https://get.rookout.com/RookoutDotnetTestConnectivity.zip):

## Debug Information

Rookout requires your application to be deployed with debug information (Pdb files `<DebugType>pdbonly</DebugType>` or `-debug+`) and the optimize flag should not be enabled (`<Optimize>false</Optimize>`)   


Pdb (Program Data Base) file is a repository to maintain information about your application. 

It stores the important debug information such as:
* file names 
* variable names 
* offsets of the functions
* file hashes

Although Rookout doesn't run your program in debug mode, we need the PDB file to properly collect the data per your request.

## Breakpoint Statuses

To provide quick feedback, Breakpoint statuses are *aggregated* across all *historic* data reported on the Breakpoint.  
Whenever you edit the Breakpoint, it's status is reset.

**These are the available statuses**:

- `Active` (solid purple) - the Breakpoint has been applied by one or more of your applications has applied the Breakpoint and no errors have been reported.
- `Pending` (hollow purple) - the Breakpoint has yet to be applied by any of your applications and no errors have been reported.
- `Error` (hollow purple with triangle) - one or more of your applications has reported an error in processing, applying or executing the Breakpoint.
- `Warning` (solid purple with triangle) - this state appears in addition to the other states, indicating that one or more of your applications has reported a warning in processing, applying or executing the Breakpoint.
- `Disabled` (hollow grey) - the Breakpoint is in a disabled state and will not collect data.

## Pending (Hollow Purple)

`Pending` status occurs when none of your applications have yet to apply the Breakpoint and no errors have been reported.

This can be caused by any of the following reasons:

#### No Application instances
You have no application instances connected to the current [project](projects.md). This is common for Serverless and batch applications which are invoked on demand.

#### Wrong Source File
The source file you used the set the breakpoint is not loaded in any of the applications in the current [project](projects.md).

#### Running with a Debugger \ Analysis tool
You are using Rookout side-by-side with another debugger \ Analysis tool such as VisualStudio or another Instrumentation analysis tool. 
We advise not to run the application without a debugger due to unexpected behavior.
