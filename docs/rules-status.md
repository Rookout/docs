Breakpoint status is a simple visual indicator designed to give you quick feedback if your Breakpoint is behvaing as expected.  

Breakpoint status appears as a lightbulb or a warnning sign next to the Breakpoint on the right pane of the screen.  
For more information on a Breakpoint status, you may click it or read more below.

## Breakpoint Statuses

To provide quick feedback, Breakpoint statuses are *aggregated* accross all *historic* data reported on the Breakpoint.  
Whenever you edit the Breakpoint, it's status is reset.

**These are the available statuses**:

- `Pending` (gray) - the Breakpoint has yet to be applied by any of your applications and no errors have been reported.
- `Active` (green) - the Breakpoint has been applied by one or more of your applications has applied the Breakpoint and no errors have been reported.
- `Error` (red) - one or more of your applications has reported an error in processing, applying or executing the Breakpoint.

- `Warning` (sign) - this state appears in addition to the other states, indicating that one or more of your applications has reported a warning in processing, applying or executing the Breakpoint.

## Pending (Gray)

`Pending` status occurs when none of your applications have yet to apply the Breakpoint and no errors have been reported.

This can be caused by any of the following reasons:

- You have no applications connected to the current [workspace](workspaces.md). This is common for Serverless and batch applications which are invoked on demand.
- The source file you used the set the breakpoint is not loaded in any of the applications in the current [workspace](workspaces.md).
- `JVM` you have set the breakpoint on a line that has no executable code associated with it.
- `JVM` you have compiled your classes without debug information. `Gradle` compiles with debug information by default but `ant` and `javac` do not.
- `Node` you are using a transpiled application without including [source maps](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Debugger/How_to/Use_a_source_map). Rookout has strong source map [support](rooks-setup.md).
- `Python`/`Node` you are debugging a package deployed as a depedency. This requires setting up your source repository [accordingly](source-repos.md#debugging-packages).
- `Python`/`Node` file paths are changed between source repository and deployment. This requires setting up your source repository [accordingly](source-repos.md#source-path-matching).

## Active Breakpoint (Green)

`Active` status occurs when one of or more of your applications has applied the Breakpoint and no errors have been reported.  
In most cases, once the Breakpoint has transitioned to active, you will see messages collected the next time the line is executed.

If you fail to see any messages arriving, this may be caused by any of the following reasons:

- You are not invoking the *correct* line of code in the correct *application instance*.
- You are using a custom Breakpoint that send the message to another [data-sink](rules-integrations.md).
- `Python` you are using a pre-forking framework. Rookout must **only** be loaded after forking, check out the [documentation](rooks-setup.md#pre-forking-servers).
- `Python/JVM` you have placed a breakpoint on a long rununing function. In this runtime, breakpoints are only applied for function calls performed after the Breakpoint was created.

## Error (Red)

`Error` status occurs when one of or more of your applications has reported an error in processing, applying or executing the Breakpoint.

`Error` indicates at least some of your application instances will fail to collect the data requested, but other application instances may be able to collect the data successfully.

`Error` messages are clearly documented within the IDE, but here are some of the common ones:
- **Source file has changed** - Rookout verifies that the source file you are seeing in our IDE is the file you deploying in your application. If the file version is wrong (detected using an Hash calculation) the Breakpoint will not be set. If you use [source commit detection](http://localhost:3000/docs/rooks-setup.html#source-commit-detection) you will see the correct git commit to use on the [App instances page](https://app.rookout.com/app/connectivity/rooks).
- `Python` **Invalid Breakpoint position** - the breakpoint has been placed where Rookout cannot set it. This includes empty lines, comments and module-scope code (outside of classes and functions). This may also mean Rookout has been imported too early - in Python it must be imported after all modules has been loaded (read more about it [here](rooks-setup.md)).

## Warning (Sign)

`Warning` status occurs when one of or more of your applications has reported a warning in processing, applying or executing the Breakpoint.

`Warning` indicates some problems have occured with the Breakpoint, and Rookout is trying it's best to deliver the you requested. This may result in the Breakpoint being executed with full success, partial success, or with no success.  
Rookout recommends you fix `Warning` whent they appear.

`Warning` messages are clearly documented within the IDE, but here are some of the common ones:
- `JVM` **Source file not found** - Rookout relies on source file hashing to ensure you are debugging the correct version of the files you are trying to debug. In JVM based languages, you need to include your source within your Jar/War/Ear archives- read more about it on our [setup page](rooks-setup.md).
