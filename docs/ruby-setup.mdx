This page will dive into the nitty gritty details on installing Rookout under various configurations.
If you are encountering any difficulties with deploying Rookout, this is the place to look.

## Ruby

The [Ruby SDK](https://rubygems.org/gems/rookout) provides the ability to fetch debug data from a running application in real time.
It can easily be installed by running the following command:


import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs
    defaultValue="gem"
    values={[
        {label: 'GemFile', value: 'gem'},
        {label: 'Bundler', value: 'bundler'},
    ]}>
<TabItem value="gem">

```bash

gem install rookout

```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="bundler">

```bash

bundle add rookout

```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Setup

Start the SDK within your application as early as possible:

```ruby

require 'rookout'
::Rookout.start token: '[Your Rookout Token]', labels: {env: "dev"}

```

<div className="rookout-org-info" />

The SDK should be imported as early as possible within your application code.
This is due to the fact you can only set non-breaking breakpoints on ruby files that have been loaded after the Rookout SDK has been started.
Usually you will want to start the Roookout SDK in a file that initializes your application, but keep in mind that you will not be able to place non-breaking breakpoints in that file.

For [Pre-forking servers](#pre-forking-servers) please read the relevant section..

## SDK API

### start

```ruby

start(**options)

```

The `start` method is used to initialize the SDK in the background and accepts the following options:

| Argument                           | Environment Variable                               | Default Value | Description                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `git_origin`                | `ROOKOUT_REMOTE_ORIGIN`                     | None          | String that indicates your git remote origin                                                                           |
| `fork`                      | `ROOKOUT_ENABLE_FORK`                       | False         | Set to `True` to enable support in forked processes                                                             |
| `host`                      | `ROOKOUT_CONTROLLER_HOST`                   | None          | If you are using a Rookout ETL Controller, this is the hostname for it                                                 |
| `port`                      | `ROOKOUT_CONTROLLER_PORT`                   | None          | If you are using a Rookout ETL Controller, this is the port for it                                                     |
| `proxy`                     | `ROOKOUT_PROXY`                             | None          | URL to proxy server (WIP)                                                                                              |
| `debug`                     | `ROOKOUT_DEBUG`                             | False         | Set to `True` to increase log level to debug                                                                    |
| `throw_errors`              | None                                               | False         | Set to `True` to throw an exception if `start` fails (error message will not be printed in console)      |

### flush

```ruby

flush()

```

The `flush` method allows explicitly flushing the Rookout logs and messages.

## Test connectivity

To make sure the SDK was properly installed in your Ruby environment, and test your configuration (environment variables only), run the following command:

```bash

rookout

```

## Source information

To enable automatic source fetching, information about the source control must be specified.

### Environment Variables or Start Parameters

Use the environment variables or start parameters as described above in the API section.

### Git Folder

Rookout gets the source information from the .git folder if both of the following apply:

1.  The .git folder is present at any of the parent directories of where the application is running (searching up the tree).
2.  No environment variables or start parameters are set for source information.

## Supported Ruby versions

| Implementation | Versions           |
| -------------- | ------------------ |
| **MRI**        | 2.6, 2.7, 3.0, 3.1 |

## Dependencies

The Ruby SDK dependencies contain native extensions. To ensure optimum compatibility, we highly recommend you build them in your local environment.
If you are using Bundler, please configure it by running:

```

bundle config force_ruby_platform true

```

## Pre-forking servers

Several popular application servers for Ruby load the application code during startup and then "fork" the process multiple times to worker processes.

If you are using one of those servers, you can set the `fork` argument in the `start` method to true. Doing so will automatically enable Rookout in any forked process, with no additional changes be required.

If you don't enable forking support, Rookout must be started in each of the workers processes.

## Serverless and PaaS deployments

### Integrating with Serverless

When integrating Rookout into a Serverless application, you should explicitly flush the collected information using the `flush` method.

**Note:** Adding the Rookout SDK will slow down your Serverless cold-start times. Please make sure your timeout is no less then 10 seconds.

### Building

If you are running your application on a Serverless or PaaS (Platform as a Service), you must build your package in an environment similar to those used in production.
If you are running on a Windows or Mac machine (or using an incompatible Linux distribution) you may encounter some issues here.

Many Serverless frameworks (such as AWS SAM) have built-in support for it and will work out of the box.

If you need to set up your own build, we recommend using Docker, with a command line such as:

```bash

docker run -v `pwd`:`pwd` -w `pwd` -i -t lambci/lambda:build-ruby2.7 pip install -r requirements.txt

```
