A Rookout Rule is defined in the context of a Workspace, and may be used to debug one or more instances of the same application.
Tags may be applied to an application instance when the Rookout SDK is loaded, and later used as filters when creating a Workspace.

## Tagging your App Instance

Passing tags to your Rooks.
Common use cases, including diagrams.

## Filtering your Workspace

Once your application instances have been tagged, you may apply the same tags as filters in your Workspaces.
For example, you could create separate workspaces for debugging different instances of the same application, or to debug the same application in different environments (dev/staging/prod, local/aws/gcp, etc.).
