This short tutorial will walk you through the perfect Rookout deployment for containerized Go applications in four quick steps.

### Get Your Application

First things first, choose an application.
If you don't have one readily available, use our [sample application](https://github.com/Rookout/go-tutorial-2022).  

Start by:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rookout/go-tutorial-2022
cd go-tutorial-2022
```

### 1. Add the GoSDK Package

Start out by adding The Rookout package:

```bash

go get -d github.com/Rookout/GoSDK

```

### 2. Start Rookout

Load and start the package to connect to your Rookout account (if you haven't signed up, do that [here](https://app.rookout.com/#mode=signUp)).

The best place to do that is at the beginning of your main function (in our case - `main.go`):

```go

import (
	// ...
	rookout "github.com/Rookout/GoSDK"
	// ...
)

func main() {
    rookout.Start(rookout.RookOptions{
		Token: "[Your Rookout Token]",
		Labels: map[string]string{"env": "dev"},
	})
    // ...
}
```

<div class="rookout-org-info"></div>

It's always best to run `tidy` after adding a new dependency:

```bash

go mod tidy

```

Make sure you install additional dependencies [if necessary](go-setup#dependencies).

Configuration is where you can get fancy. You have got additional options up your sleeve:
1. Move options from environment variables to secret or configuration managers.
2. If you are using a [Rookout Controller](etl-controller-intro), set up the remote host and port configuration.
3. Dig deeper into other options available right [here](go-setup#start).

### 3. Build the Application

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs
defaultValue="general"
values={[
{label: 'General', value: 'general'},
{label: 'Alpine', value: 'alpine'},
]}>

<TabItem value="general">

```bash

go build -gcflags="all=-dwarflocationlists=true"

```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="alpine">

```bash

go build -gcflags="all=-dwarflocationlists=true" -tags=alpine

```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 4. Embed Source Information

Rookout offers the smoothest debugging experience by fetching up-to-date source code for each server.

Set this up for containerized applications by adding a handful of [files](https://www.rookout.com/blog/embedding-source-code-version-information-in-docker-images/) from your `.git` folder to the container image.

Edit (or add) your `.dockerignore` file and adapt the traditional `.git` exclude:
```ignore
# Keep ignoring .git
.git
# Allow specific files with !
!.git/HEAD
!.git/config
!.git/refs
```

Add a final `COPY` command to the `Dockerfile`.
```docker
COPY .git /.git
```

*Note:* in [multi-stage](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/) builds like ours, make this change in the **final** stage.

### Test

**One second!** if you are not using our demo app, please commit and push your changes to a new branch.

Build and run your Docker image:
```
docker build . -t rookout-go-todo
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 rookout-go-todo
```

As your Go application spins up, search for this output at the top:
<img src="/img/screenshots/go_success.png" />

Interact with your application at `http://localhost:8080` and use Rookout to debug it on the fly!
