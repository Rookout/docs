## Slack

In rookout, as you debug your app, you can share the data you extract using slack.
On the message there is a share button which has an authorize slack app button.
To enable the use of Rookoutâ€™s slack integration for message sharing, simply authorize the app by pressing the button and authorizing Rookout-Share in the opened window.
There is no need to install Rookout in your Slack workspace.
Rookout will send the message from your user straight to your chosen channel.

1. While viewing a message click the share button.
