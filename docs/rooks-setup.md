## Python

#### Introduction

The Python Rook provides the ability to fetch debug data from a running application in real time.
It is deployed by deploying the [Rook SDK](https://pypi.org/project/rook/).
It can easily be installed by running the following command:
```bash
    $ pip install rook
```

#### Basic setup

Setup the Rookout token in your environment:
```bash
# Export your token as an environment variable
$ export ROOKOUT_TOKEN=[Your Rookout Token]
```

Tag your environment:
```bash
# Use a set of semicolon separated values to identify specific deployments and configurations
$ export ROOKOUT_TAGS=[;;;]
```

Import the Rook within your application:
```python
# Import the package in your app's entry-point file, just before it starts
from rook import auto_start
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Your program starts here :)
```

The Rook should be imported as late as possible within the application.
The reason for this is that it’s impossible to know in Python if a module is fully loaded and if all classes within it have been defined. Unlike JS and it’s hoisting concept, classes in Python are created when the interpreter first executes them. If we’ll see a partially loaded module and failed to set a breakpoint in it (because the class has not been defined yet) setting the breakpoint will fail and the user will receive an error.

#### Supported Python versions

| Implementation     | Versions           |
| ------------------ | ------------------ |
| **CPython**        | 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 |
| **PyPy**           | 6.0.0              |

***Note:*** We recommend avoiding production deployment for Windows based apps.

#### Source Commit Detection

The Python Rook supports detecting the existing source code commit in the following methods, in descending order of priority:
1. If the environment variable “ROOKOUT_COMMIT” exists, use it.
2. If the environment variable “ROOKOUT_GIT” exists, search for the configuration of the “.git” folder and use its head.
3. If the main application is running from within a Git repository, use its head. 

#### Dependencies

The Rookout Python SDK contains native extensions. For most common interpreter and OS configurations, pre-built binaries are provided. For other configurations, a build environment is needed to successfully install Rookout.

If you encounter an error similar to the following example, be sure to install the environment specific build tools specified below:

```bash
    Could not find <Python.h>. This could mean the following:
      * You're on Ubuntu and haven't run `apt-get install python-dev`.
      * You're on RHEL/Fedora and haven't run `yum install python-devel` or
        `dnf install python-devel` (make sure you also have redhat-rpm-config
        installed)
      * You're on Mac OS X and the usual Python framework was somehow corrupted
        (check your environment variables or try re-installing?)
      * You're on Windows and your Python installation was somehow corrupted
        (check your environment variables or try re-installing?)
```
1. Mac
    - $ xcode-select --install
2. Debian based
    - $ apt-get update -q && apt-get install -qy g++ python-dev
3. Fedora based
    - $ yum install -qy gcc-c++ python-devel
4. Alpine
    - $ apk update && apk add g++ python-dev

#### Serverless and PaaS deployments

If you are running your application on a Serverless or PaaS (Platform as a Service), you must build your package in an environment similar to those used in production. 
If you are running on a Windows or Mac machine (or using an incompatible Linux distribution) you may encounter some issues here.

Many Serverless frameworks (such as AWS sam) have built-in support for it and will work out of the box.

If you need to set up your own build, we recommend using Docker, with a command line such as:
```bash
    $ docker run -it -v `pwd`:`pwd` -w `pwd` python:2.7 pip install -t lib
```

## Node

#### Introduction

The Node.js Rook provides the ability to fetch debug data from a running application in real time.
It is deployed by deploying the [Rook SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rookout).
It can easily be installed by running the following command:
```bash
$ npm install --save rookout
```

#### Basic setup

Setup the Rookout token in your environment:
```bash
// Export your token as an environment variable
$ export ROOKOUT_TOKEN=[Your Rookout Token]
```

Tag your environment:
```bash
// Use a set of semicolon separated values to identify specific deployments and configurations
$ export ROOKOUT_TAGS=[;;;]
```

Import the Rook within your application:
```javascript
const rook = require('rookout/auto_start');
```

#### Supported Versions

| Implementation     | Versions       |
| ------------------ | -------------- |
| **Node**           | 4.3+, 6, 8, 10  |

**Note:** Rookout only supports LTS (Long Time Support) versions of Node.js.

#### Source Commit Detection
Source commit detection functionality is currently not supported for Node.js.

#### Serverless and PaaS
If you are running your application on a Serverless or PaaS (Platform as a Service), you must build your package in an environment similar to those used in production. 
If you are running on a Windows or Mac machine (or using an incompatible Linux distribution) you may encounter some issues here.

Many Serverless frameworks (such as AWS sam) has built-in support for it and will work out of the box.

If you need to set up your own build, we recommend using Docker, with a command line such as:

docker run -it -v `pwd`:`pwd` -w `pwd` node:8 pip install -t lib

## Java

#### Introduction

The Java Rook provides the ability to fetch debug data from a running application in real time.
It is deployed by deploying the [Rook SDK](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.rookout/rook).

It can be download directly to the target system by running the following command:
```bash
$ curl -L "https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.rookout&a=rook&v=LATEST" -o rook.jar
```
It can also be installed by adding the dependency in Rookout in JVM build systems such as Maven or Gradle.

For Gradle:

```javascript
dependencies {
   runtime group: 'com.rookout', name: 'rook', version:'0.1.31'
}
```

#### Basic Setup

Setup the Rookout token in your environment:
```bash
// Export your token as an environment variable
$ export ROOKOUT_TOKEN=[Your Rookout Token]
```

Tag your environment:
```bash
// Use a set of semicolon separated values to identify specific deployments and configurations
$ export ROOKOUT_TAGS=[;;;]
```

Add the Java agent to your application:
```bash
$ export JAVA_OPTIONS="$JAVA_OPTIONS -javaagent:(pwd)/rook.jar"
```

#### Supported Versions

| Implementation     | Versions      |
| ------------------ | ------------- |
| **Oracle Java**    | 7u111, 8u91   |
| **OpenJDK**        | 1.7, 1.8      |

The following languages are officially jupported: Java, Scala, Kotlin, Groovy, ColdFusion.
**Note:** Alpine Linux is currently not supported.

If the environment you are trying to debug is not mentioned in the list above, be sure to let us know: support@rookout.com .

#### Packaging Sources

Unlike Node and Python applications, most JVM applications do not include their source code within the library distribution. This prevents Rookout from verifying the source files have not changed between what the user sees and the production and will trigger a warning.

In order to shut off the warning and gain the value of source verification, you should include your source files within your JAR/WAR/EAR library.

For Gradle, use the following snippet:
```java
jar {
   from sourceSets.main.allSource
}
```

For Maven, use the following snippet:
```xml
    <resources>
        <resource>
            <directory>${basedir}/src/main/java</directory>
        </resource>
    </resources>
```

#### Source Commit Detection

The Java Rook supports detecting the existing source code commit in the following methods, in descending order of priority:
1. If the environment variable “ROOKOUT_COMMIT” exists, use it.
2. If the Java main application is jar/war/ear and it’s manifest includes the value “ROOKOUT_MANIFEST_COMMIT”, use it.

#### Dependencies

None.

#### Serverkess and PaaS

For using Java under a Serverless/PaaS environment, the following must be taken into account:
- Include the Java Agent in your application package.
- In many cloud platforms, passing JVM command line arguments are not supported. If so, be sure to use the Rookout API described above.
- For Serverless applications, you must call the Rookout API on every endpoint and flush at your discretion.
- In some Serverless environments, the tools.jar library is missing and must be included within your package as well.
