title: Python Rook
---


The Python Rook is a python package that runs inside the user's application.  
This allows us to remotely inspect the state of the process.

## Installation

To install Python Rook into the currently active python environment simply run:
```bash
$ pip install rook
```

## Running

To activate Python Rook within your app, add the following line to your Python code as early as possible:
```python
from rook import auto_start
```

For more control over the Python Rook initialization, check out this [page](rooks-python_interface.md).

## Source Code Version

Python Rook will attempt to determine the current Git commit the application is based off, and will report it.
The resolution takes place in the following steps:
1. If there's an environment variable named 'ROOKOUT_COMMIT' use it.
1. If there's an environment variable named 'ROOKOUT_GIT' get the current Git head from that path.
1. If the application is running from a Git repo, get the current Git head for that repo.
