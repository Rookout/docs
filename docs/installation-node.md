## Adding a Node.js Rook

__Pre-requisites:__  
- *Node v4.x/v6.x/v8.x* ([download here](https://nodejs.org/))
1. Add our npm package to your package.json :  
    ```bash 
    $ npm install --save rookout
    ```
    
1. Require the package in your app's entry-point file :  
    ```javascript
    const rook = require('rookout/auto_start');
    ```
    
Once your application is deployed, navigate to the Rookout App Instances page to make sure it is available for debugging.
