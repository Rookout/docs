Labels are key/value pairs that are attached to running application instances.

Labels can be used to organize and select groups of application instances.
In this example organization, there are three environments - development, staging, and production with 4 different services in each environment.

### Setting up your Rookout deployment

When installing the Rookout SDK, you may provide the service name and environment name as labels.
For example, service #3 in Production may be configured using the following:

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs
    defaultValue="python"
    values={[
        {label: 'Python', value: 'python'},
        {label: 'Node', value: 'node'},
        {label: 'JVM', value: 'jvm'},
        {label: '.NET', value: 'dotnet'},
    ]}>

<TabItem value="python">
```python

rook.start(token='[Your Rookout Token]',
           labels={"service":"service#3","env":"dev"})

```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="node">
```javascript

rook.start({
    token: '[Your Rookout Token]', 
    labels:
        {
            "service":"service#3",
            "env":"dev"
        }

});

```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="jvm">

```bash

# Export your labels as an environment variable
export ROOKOUT_LABELS=service:service3,env:dev

```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="dotnet">

```cs

Rook.RookOptions options = new Rook.RookOptions() 
    {
        token = "[Your Rookout Token]",
        labels = new Dictionary<string, string> { { "service", "service#3" }, { "env", "dev" } }
    };
Rook.API.Start(options);

```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<div className="rookout-org-info" />


Altenatively, labels can be added as environment variables in Python and Node as well:

```bash

export ROOKOUT_LABELS='service:service3,env:dev'

```

## Examples

### Debug all instances of specific service

When creating your Rookout Project, use the following filter to debug all instances of service #3 (in Production, Staging and Dev).

1.  Add the following filter: `service:service#3` 

2.  Import the source code for service #3.

### Debug all instances in specific environment

When creating your Rookout Project, use the following filter to debug only instances running in Production.

1.  Add the following filter: `env:production` 

2.  Import the source code of the relevant service.

### Debug specific instance in specific enviroment

To refine the filter, you may use the following filter to debug only the instance of service #3 running in Staging.

1.  Add the following filters: `env:staging` `service:service#3`

2.  Import the source code for service #3.
