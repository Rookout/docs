## Installation

Install the Rookout [Node SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rookout)) using one of the following methods:

<!--DOCUSAURUS_CODE_TABS-->

<!--NPM-->

```bash
npm install --save rookout
```

<!--Yarn-->

```bash
yarn add rookout
```

<!--END_DOCUSAURUS_CODE_TABS-->

## Setup

To add the SDK to your application, add:

```javascript
const rookout = require('rookout');
```

Then, in your appâ€™s entry point, add:

```javascript
rookout.start({
    token: '[Your Rookout Token]',
    labels:
        {
            "env": "dev" // Optional, see the Labels page for more info.
        }
});
```
<div class="rookout-org-info"></div>

Note that the `rookout.start` method returns a promise that resolves when the connection attempt succeeds (fullfill) or fails (reject). You can choose to utilize that Promise or to ignore it.

## Configuration

The following table includes all configuration options. Pass them to the `rookout.start` method or using environment variables.

| Parameter | Environment Variable | Default Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `token` | `ROOKOUT_TOKEN` | None | The Rookout token for your organization. May be left empty if you are using a Rookout ETL Controller |
| `labels` | `ROOKOUT_LABELS` | {} | A dictionary of key:value labels for your application instances. Use `k:v,k:v` format for environment variables |
| `git_commit` | `ROOKOUT_COMMIT` | None | String that indicates your git commit or a branch name |
| `git_origin` | `ROOKOUT_REMOTE_ORIGIN` | None | String that indicates your git remote origin |
| `host` | `ROOKOUT_CONTROLLER_HOST` | None | If you are using a Rookout ETL Controller, this is the hostname for it |
| `port` | `ROOKOUT_CONTROLLER_PORT` | None | If you are using a Rookout ETL Controller, this is the port for it |
| `proxy` | `ROOKOUT_PROXY` | None | URL to proxy server
| `debug` | `ROOKOUT_DEBUG` | False | Set to `True` to increase log level to debug |
| `throw_errors` | --- | False | Set to `True` to reject the promsise or throw an exception if `start` fails (error messages are not printed to the console when this is set) |
| `sources` | `ROOKOUT_SOURCES` | None | Source information (see below) |
| NONE | `ROOKOUT_LIVE_LOGGER` | False | Set to `True` to enable Rookout [Live Logger](live-logger.md) |

## Transpiling and Bundling

If your application's code is being transpiled or bundled, you must include the source maps, either "in-line" or as separate files.

### Configuration for common tools

- [**Webpack**](https://webpack.js.org/) - use either the `inline-source-map` or `source-map` values for the `devtool` option in the webpack config file ([reference](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/devtool)).
- [**Babel**](https://babeljs.io/) - use either the `inline` or `true` values for the `sourceMaps` option in the Babel config file ([reference](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/options#sourcemaps)).
- [**TypeScript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - add either `"inlineSourceMap": true` or `"sourceMap": true` in the TypeScript config file ([reference](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#inlineSourceMap)).
- [**CoffeeScript**](https://coffeescript.org/) - pass either the `-M` (inline) or `-m` flags to the `coffee` CLI tool ([reference](https://coffeescript.org/#usage)).

### Advanced transpiling configurations

If multiple transpiling steps are used (for example - TypeScript followed by Webpack), you may need to add a step to your Webpack config. 

For webpack, use `source-map-loader`:

1. Install using `npm install -D source-map-loader`
2. Add the following rule to the webpack config file (under `rules`):

```js
 {
    test: /\.js$/,
    use: ["source-map-loader"],
    enforce: "pre"
 }
```

## Supported Versions

Rookout supports the latest NodeJS and all releases that are under maintenance (LTS). Support for older versions is limited.

| Support             | Versions                       |
| ---                | ---                            |
| **Full**           | 12 (>= 12.9), 14               |
| **Limited**        | 8, 10, 11, 12 (< 12.9), 13, 15 |

**Note:** The Rookout NodeJS SDK does not support running side-by-side with another debugger.

## Serverless and PaaS Deployments

### Integrating with serverless

For AWS Lambda, it is recommended to use the provided wrapper like so:

```js
const rookout = require('rookout/lambda');

function handler(event, context, callback) {
        callback(null, "Hello World");
}

exports.handler = rookout.wrap(handler, {token:'[Your Rookout Token]', labels:{"env":"dev"}});
```
<div class="rookout-org-info"></div>

**Note:** Although Rookout's impact on performance is negligible during regular use, the Rookout SDK does slow down serverless cold starts. Please make sure your function's timeout is higher than 10 seconds.
