## Hi, welcome to Rookout!

Rookouts lets you fetch data from live, remote applications, without changing code and without waiting for a restart.

Once the Rookout SDK is deployed, debug snapshots and and log lines may be collected with a click of a button.

## Rookout Live Debugger

Rookout Live Debugger provides a debugger-like production-grade tool for applications running in a wide variety of technologies and deployments.

Use Non-Breaking Breakpoints to instantly see the full state of your app, including variable values, stack traces, and more.

## Rookout Live Logger

Rookout Live Logger provides a live-tail-like experience, letting you increase log verbosity immediately and safely.

Use advanced, context based filters to switch on hidden Debug or Trace log lines and quickly get to the root cause of an issue.

## Integrate with your version control

When working on a remote environment, it's imperative to know exactly what source code it's executing.

Rookout integrates with your source-control provider to fetch you the correct source code for each and every environment (see our [source code security page](https://www.rookout.com/security/source-code-security) for more info).

## Integrate with your observability tools

When investigating application issues, existing observability tools such as logging, tracing and error tracking, are an important source of information.

Rookout integrates with those services to show you the corresponding transaction identifiers.

Rookout even empowers you to add logs, metrics, and alerts to running applications on the fly, seeing them side-by-side with traditional logs and metrics.

## Key features

1.  Debug multiple applications simultaneously.
2.  Conditional breakpoints for pinpoint collection.
3.  Profiling capabilities.
4.  Version control integration.
5.  OpenTracing integration.
6.  Create new logs, metrics and alerts.
7.  Negligible performance overhead with strict controls.
8.  Enterprise grade [security](https://www.rookout.com/security).

## How does it work?

Rookout's SDKs and agents use bytecode-manipulation (and similar techniques) to instantly add the instructions for data collection to the application's code as soon as you add a non-breaking breakpoint.

## What's next?

-   Sign up to [Rookout](https://app.rookout.com) and [deploy](setup-intro.md) on your first application.
-   Find your specific deployment in our [Deployment Examples](deployment-examples.md).
-   Checkout the [Rookout workshop](https://github.com/Rookout/rookout-training) on GitHub.
-   Reach out to us if anything is unclear: {"{"}@inject: supportEmail{"}"}.
