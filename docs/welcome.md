## Hi, welcome to Rookout!  

Rookouts helps you fix bugs and understand your code by instantly collecting application state from any line of code in live applications.

Once you deploy the SDK, no additional coding, redeploying or restarting of your application is required!

## Non-breaking breakpoints

Rookout provides you with a debugger-like production-grade tool for applications built using any architecture running in any environment.

Understading bugs often gets difficult when relying on the existing, limited, outputs of the system.

Easily set a non-breaking breakpoint on any line of code to immediately see the full state, including variables values, stack traces, and more.

## Integrate with your version control

When working on a remote enviorment, it's imperative to know exactly what source code it's executing.

Rookout integrates with your source-control provider to fetch you the correct source code for each and every enviorment ([security information)](https://www.rookout.com/security/source-code-security).

## Integrate with your observability tools

When investigating application issues, existing observability tools such as logging, tracing and error tracking, are an important source of information.

Rookout integrates with those services to offer show you the correspending transaction identifiers.

Rookout even empowers you to add logs, metrics, and alerts to running applications on the fly, seeing them side-by-side with traditional logs and metrics.

## Key features

1. Debug multiple application simultaneously.
1. Conditional breakpoints for pinpoint collection.
1. Version control integration.
1. OpenTracing integration.
1. Create new logs, metrics and alerts.
1. Negligible performance overhead with strict controls.
1. Enterprise grade [security](https://www.rookout.com/security).

## How does it work?

Rookout's SDKs and agents use bytecode-manipulation (and similar techniques) to instantly add the instructions for data collection to the application's code as soon as you add a non-breaking breakpoint.

## What's next?

- Sign up to [Rookout](https://app.rookout.com) and [deploy](setup-intro.md) on your first application.
- Find your specific deployment in our [Deployment Examples](deployment-examples.md).
- Reach out to us if anything is unclear: {@inject: supportEmail}.
