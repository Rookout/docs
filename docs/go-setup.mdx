This page dives into the nitty-gritty details on installing Rookout under various configurations. If you encounter difficulties with deploying Rookout, this is the place to look.

## Setup

Rookout's Go SDK is served from a [public repository](github.com/Rookout/GoSDK) on Github. 

### Get the package

Run the following inside your app’s directory to add the Rookout SDK to the `go.mod` file - 

```bash

go get -d github.com/Rookout/GoSDK

```

This command will fetch the Rookout SDK from our repository onto your machine, and will also add the Rookout SDK as a dependency to your project (adding it to the `go.mod` file). You should only run this command one time.

:::note 

The `-d` flag ensures that the package will be downloaded and added to `go.mod`, but not installed.

:::

### Start Rookout within your application

Go to the file containing your `main` package and import Rookout:

```go

import (
    rookout "github.com/Rookout/GoSDK"
)

```

Then, in your `main` function, as early as possible, call `rookout.Start`:

```go 

err := rookout.Start(rookout.RookOptions{token=[your-rookout-token]})
fmt.Println(err)

```

For a list of optional arguments to pass to the `Start` function, see the [SDK configuration section](#start). 

### Build the application

#### Enable CGO

Make sure that CGO isn’t disabled. It is enabled by default but may be changed using the `CGO_ENABLED` variable. Make sure it is not disabled in your environment variables as well as the Go tool environment. 

```bash

echo ${CGO_ENABLED} && go env | grep CGO_ENABLED

```

#### Operating system dependencies

Depending on your OS, you may need to install additional dependencies: 

// todo reorganize the list, add it here 

#### Specify the OS distribution as a tag

Specify the OS distribution as a tag to the `go build` command using the `-tags` parameter:

// todo determine the list here

#### LD flags

Rookout may not work with some LD flags (-s, -w). These are often passed in the `go build` command using `-ldflags`.

#### gcflags 

We recommend using the following gcflags for your go build: 

```bash

-gcflags="all=-dwarflocationlists=true"

```

This configuration minimizes Rookout’s CPU usage within our clients' application, while providing nearly complete coverage of the project and its dependencies. 

A user can decide to replace `all` with `./...`. This will apply the gcflags chosen exclusively to the project code. `all` can also be replaced with the name of a specific package or regex to choose specific modules to cover.

Note: to attain complete code coverage at the cost of user resource consumption, the following gcflags can be configured: 

```bash

-gcflags 'all=-N -l'

```

## Dynamically linking dependencies 

By default, the Rookout module links its dependencies statically. This is done to support multi-stage docker images, running on distroless images, having separate build and run machines, or any other reason for not having all the operating system dependencies the Rookout SDK needs, installed on the machine that will run your application.

To configure Rookout to dynamically link dependencies, add another tag to the `-tags` flag of the `go build` command, called `rookout_dynamic` - e.g., `-tags=ubuntu20,rookout_dynamic`. Doing so means all the OS dependencies must exist on the target machine on which the application is going to run.

:::note 

Cross-compiling may not work out-of-the-box for you. In this case please contact us for assistance at <SupportEmail />

## SDK Configuration 

### Start

```go 

Start(labels)
```
The `Start` method is used to initialize the SDK and it accepts the following variables:

| Environment Variable                        | Default Value | Description                                                                                                            |

| `ROOKOUT_TOKEN`                             | None          | The Rookout token for your organization. Should be left empty if you are using a Rookout ETL Controller                |
| `ROOKOUT_LABELS`                            | {}            | A dictionary of key:value labels for your application instances. Use `k:v,k:v` format for environment variables        |
