This page dives into the nitty-gritty details on installing Rookout under various configurations. If you encounter difficulties with deploying Rookout, this is the place to look.

## Installation

Rookout's Go SDK is served from a public repository on github. 

### Get the package

Run the following inside your app’s directory to add the Rookout SDK to the go.mod file - 

```bash

go get -d github.com/Rookout/GoSDK

```

This command will fetch the Rookout SDK from our private repository onto your machine, and will also add the Rookout SDK as a dependency to your project (adding it to the go.mod file). You should only run this command one time.

:::note 

Don’t forget to add the -d flag to go get so that the package will be downloaded and added to go.mod, but not installed. This is the best practice according to the Go official documentation.

:::

:::note 

If your app is running in a container, you will need to first follow the instructions up to this point on a local machine (to add the Rookout SDK to go.mod), then configure the Go tool environment variables in the container image as well, so that go mod download will be able to fetch our SDK.

:::

### Add code to start Rookout within your application

Now that we have the Rookout SDK as a dependency, we need to start it from within your application. Go to the file containing your main package and import Rookout:

```go

import (
    rookout "github.com/Rookout/GoSDK"
)

```

Then, in your main function, as early as possible, call rookout.start like so:

```go 

err := rookout.Start(rookout.RookOptions{token=[your-rookout-token]})
fmt.Println(err)

```

// todo link the environment variables for rookout.start

### Build the application

#### Enable CGO

Make sure that CGO isn’t disabled. It is enabled by default but may be changed using the CGO_ENABLED variable. Make sure it is not disabled in your environment variables as well as the Go tool environment. 

```bash

echo ${CGO_ENABLED} && go env | grep CGO_ENABLED

```

#### Remove some LD flags

Rookout may not work with some LD flags (-s, -w), these are often passed in the go build command using -ldflags.

#### Operating system dependencies

Depending on your OS, you may need to install additional dependencies: 

// todo reorganize the list, add it here 

#### Add gcflags 

We recommend using the following gcflags for your go build: 

```bash

-gcflags="all=-dwarflocationlists=true"

```

This configuration minimizes Rookout’s CPU usage within our clients' application, while providing nearly complete coverage of the project and its dependencies. 

A user can decide to replace `all` with `./...`. This will apply the gcflags chosen exclusively to the project code. `all` can also be replaced with the name of a specific package or regex to choose specific modules to cover.

Note: to attain complete code coverage at the cost of user resource consumption, the following gcflags can be configured: 

```bash

-gcflags 'all=-N -l'

```

#### Specify the OS distribution as a tag

Specify the OS distribution as a tag to the go build command using the -tags parameter:

// todo determine the list here

## Dynamically linking dependencies 

By default, the Rookout module links its dependencies statically. This is done to support multi-stage docker images, running on distroless images, having separate build and run machines, or any other reason for not having all the operating system dependencies the Rookout SDK needs, installed on the machine that will run your application.

To configure Rookout to dynamically link dependencies, add another tag to the `-tags` flag of the `go build` command, called `rookout_dynamic` - e.g., `-tags=ubuntu20,rookout_dynamic`. Doing so means all the OS dependencies must exist on the target machine on which the application is going to run.

:::note 

Cross-compiling may not work out-of-the-box for you. In this case please contact us for assistance.

## SDK Configuration 

### start

```go 

Start(labels)
```
The `Start` method is used to initialize the SDK and it accepts the following variables:

| Environment Variable                        | Default Value | Description                                                                                                            |
