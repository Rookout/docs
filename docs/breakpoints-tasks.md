## Data Redaction

The [filter operation](breakpoints-reference.md#filter) may be used to perform data redaction on the data fetched by a Breakpoint before sending it to its destination.  

The pattern support only regex strings.

For example, adding the following snippet to the Breakpoint Operations section:
```json
{
  "name": "filter",
  "filters": [
    {
      "filter_type": "name",
      "pattern": "secretKey"
    },
    {
      "filter_type": "value",
      "pattern": "[0-9]+"
    }
  ]
}
```

Will replace an instance of "secretKey":"12345" with "secretKey":"[REDACTED]", and an instance of "nameAndPassword":"LordHelmet-12345" with "nameAndPassword":"LordHelmet-****".

### Whitelisting

Specify which variable you want to extract using a regular expression that will be applied on the variable name only.

```java
class Dog {
	String name;
	int age;

	public Dog(String dogName) {
		this.name = dogName;
		this.age = 0;
	}
}

class Zoo {
	Dog dog;
	Cat cat;
	int numberOfAnimals;

	public Zoo() {
		this.dog = new Dog("Shtubi");
		this.numberOfAnimals = 1;
	}
}
```

For example, to collect only the dog member, add the following snippet to the Breakpoint Operations section:
```json
{
  "name": "filter",
  "whitelist": true,
  "filters": [
    {
      "filter_type": "name", 
      "pattern": "dog"
    }
  ]
}
```

The `dog` member will be returned entirely, while the other members will be redacted.

## Rate Limiting

Rookout set a threshold on the rate Breakpoints are invoked within a single application instance to ensure there's no perfomance degradation when accidentally setting breakpoints on hot code path.

If a Breakpoint is invoked twice within the limit (set by default to *100ms*) the Breakpoint will be disabled for that application instance and it's status will be set to `Error`.

To change this configuration for a specific Breakpoint, change the value of `minTimeBetweenHits` to the desired number in miliseconds:
```json
"minTimeBetweenHits" : 10
```

## Including Packages

By default, Rookout doesn't set breakpoints inside the application's dependencies (`node_modules` for Node, `site-packages` for Python, inapplicable for JVM).

This setting may be changed at the repository level by following the instructions [here](source-repos.md#debugging-packages).  
Alternatively, you may change the value of `includeExternals` (under the `location` object) to `true` inside a specific breakpoint:
```json
"includeExternals" : true
```
