### If you are required to use a proxy please read carefully!

## Setting up the proxy for the current environment
If you are setting your proxy using an environment variable, be sure to do it this way before any command you
execute that may need it:
- **UNIX:** \`export HTTPS_PROXY=<[protocol://][user:password@]proxyhost[:port]>\`
  Example: \`export HTTPS_PROXY=https://myuser:password@proxy.rookout.com:1234\`
- **WINDOWS:** \`set HTTPS_PROXY=<[protocol://][user:password@]proxyhost[:port]>\`
  Example: \`set HTTPS_PROXY=https://myuser:password@proxy.rookout.com:1234\`


When executing commands as SUDO the proxy environment variable is not kept.
In order to fix this we need to tell the system to not reset these variables when running as sudo -
to do this follow these steps:
- Editing /etc/sudoers by running \`sudo visudo\`. This is a dedicated command that opens your default text editor
to edit these settings.
- Find the line \`Defaults env_reset\`
- After this line, add \`Defaults env_keep="HTTPS_PROXY"\`
- Save and quit

## Installing a Rook
To make sure the proxy is used when downloading the rook dependency, execute the command like this:
\`export HTTPS_PROXY=https://myuser:password@proxy.rookout.com:1234 && packagemanager rookout\`

__IF USING WINDOWS: REPLACE \`export\` by \`set\`__

### Python:
\`\`\`bash
export HTTPS_PROXY=https://myuser:password@proxy.rookout.com:1234 && pip install rook
\`\`\`

### Node:
\`\`\`bash
export HTTPS_PROXY=https://myuser:password@proxy.rookout.com:1234 && npm install --save rookout
\`\`\`

### Java:
\`\`\`bash
export HTTPS_PROXY=https://myuser:password@proxy.rookout.com:1234 && curl -L "https://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.rookout&a=rook&v=LATEST" -o rook.jar
\`\`\`

## Installing and running the Agent
If you are installing the Rookout Agent, use this argument when running the setup script: --https-proxy
\`bash setup.sh --token=<Your-Token> --https-proxy=<Your-Proxy>\`

If the agent is already installed, you can edit the configuration file \`/etc/default/rookout-agent\`
and set the environment variable as explained beforehand: \`export HTTPS_PROXY=...\`. Save the file and restart the agent
by running: \`systemctl restart rookout-agent\`

More details are [available here](/docs/installation-agent-proxy.html)

## Using simple-https server
In order to download it from NPM using the proxy run this command with your correct proxy:
\`\`\`bash
export HTTPS_PROXY=https://myuser:password@proxy.rookout.com:1234 && npm install -g simple-https
\`\`\`


Using a proxy will not work as the https certificate created is for \`localhost\`
Make sure you are disabling the \`Use SSL\` option when configuring the file server in our App.
You can then use the \`--no-ssl\` flag for local file serving.

## Gray - Rule is pending
- Rule is not being applied because of selectors
- Rule is not being applied because there are no agents
- Rule is not being applied because there are no Rooks
- Rule is not being applied because the appropriate Rooks are not connected
- Rule is not being applied because paths differ (Python/Node)
- Rule is not being applied because source maps are missing (Node)

## Orange - Rule is Warning
- Error in script
- Source missing (Java)


## Red - Rule is Error
- JSON is invalid
  - JSON has failed loading/processing
  - Check your JSON against documentation and templates
- Hash mismatch
  - Source file differs between configuration and production
  - **Future features:** smaller hashes, identify production file based on hash and display
- Python Bdb failed to find code
  - Two “features”:
    - In Python there is no “Hoisting” and code objects are only created as their definitions are executed.
    Today, we are unable to know if this has happened and will assume any loaded module has been fully loaded.
    - In order to avoid this problem, import rook only after modules has been properly initialized. A common use-case
    is loaded just before if __name__ == “__main__”
  - Module scope instrumentation is not supported under CPython

- Test connectivity
  \`python -m rook\`
- Python versions:
    - CPython 2.7 on Linux
    - PYPY (any version) on Linux
- Installation
  - Python rook needs to be installed within the application's virtualenv
  - Old installation tools can cause issues. Attempt to upgrade pip and remove distribute (deprecated, only if exists):
    - \`pip install -U pip\`
    - \`pip uninstall distribute\`
- Installation requires compiling some Python extensions on the fly, this requires the following packages:
  - apt
    - \`$ apt-get update -q\`
    - \`$ apt-get install -qy g++ python-dev\`
  - yum
    - \`$ yum install -qy gcc-c++ python-devel\`
